The film was a critical and commercial success in France and abroad, earning an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language Film and winning three CÃ©sar Awards, including Best Poster. It also became a cult classic among cinephiles and fans of erotic cinema, thanks to its explicit and passionate sex scenes, its vivid cinematography, and its eclectic soundtrack.
 
The film was originally released in a 120-minute version, but Beineix later restored his preferred 185-minute director's cut, which adds more depth and nuance to the characters and their story. The director's cut was first released on DVD in 2005, and then on Blu-Ray in 2013 by PublicHD. The Blu-Ray edition features a stunning 720p transfer that preserves the film's original aspect ratio of 1.66:1 and showcases its vibrant colors and rich details. The audio is presented in French DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0, with optional English subtitles. The Blu-Ray also includes a booklet with an essay by critic Chelsea Phillips-Carr, a video interview with Beineix, a documentary on the making of the film, and the original theatrical trailer.
 
Betty Blue is a film that explores the extremes of love and madness, with a captivating performance by Dalle as the unforgettable heroine. It is a film that deserves to be seen in its full glory on Blu-Ray, as Beineix intended. If you are a fan of French cinema, erotic drama, or simply a powerful and moving story, you should not miss this opportunity to own Betty Blue on Blu-Ray.
  
Betty Blue is not only a film about love and madness, but also a film about art and creativity. Zorg is a frustrated writer who has a manuscript hidden in his closet, which Betty discovers and reads. She is impressed by his talent and encourages him to pursue his dream of becoming a published author. She even sends his manuscript to various publishers without his knowledge, hoping to get him a deal. However, her efforts are met with rejection and indifference, which fuels her anger and resentment towards the world.
 
The film also explores the contrast between the urban and rural settings, and how they affect the characters and their relationship. The film begins in a seaside town in the south of France, where Zorg and Betty live in a simple but idyllic bungalow by the beach. They enjoy a carefree and passionate life, surrounded by nature and sunshine. However, when they move to Paris, they face a harsh and hostile environment, full of noise, pollution, and violence. They struggle to find a place to live and a job to survive, and their relationship becomes strained and unstable.
