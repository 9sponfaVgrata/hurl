Statistical quality control (SQC) is a method of using statistical tools and techniques to monitor and improve the quality of products and processes. SQC can help reduce variability, defects, waste, and costs, as well as increase customer satisfaction and profitability.
 
One of the challenges of implementing SQC in Indonesia is the lack of standardized and accessible resources on the topic. Many books and manuals on SQC are written in English or other languages, which may not be suitable for Indonesian learners and practitioners. Moreover, some of the available resources may not reflect the specific needs and conditions of the Indonesian context.

One of the industries that can benefit from SQC is software production. Software production is different from manufacturing because it involves intangible and complex products that are difficult to measure and control. However, software quality is crucial for customer satisfaction, competitive advantage, and business success.
 
According to a literature review by **Putri et al. (2021)** [^1^], SQC can help software producers to monitor and improve their processes and products by using tools such as control charts, histograms, Pareto charts, cause-and-effect diagrams, and design of experiments. These tools can help identify and eliminate the sources of variation and defects in software development and testing, as well as optimize the performance and functionality of software products.
 
The literature review also suggests some challenges and recommendations for implementing SQC in software production in Indonesia. Some of the challenges include the lack of awareness and knowledge of SQC among software producers, the resistance to change and innovation, the diversity of software products and processes, and the difficulty of collecting and analyzing data. Some of the recommendations include providing training and education on SQC for software producers, establishing a quality culture and commitment, adapting SQC tools to suit the specific needs and characteristics of software production, and using automated tools and systems for data collection and analysis.
